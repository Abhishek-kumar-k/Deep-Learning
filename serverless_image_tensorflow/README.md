 ## Setup and Install

 **TensorFlow REST API - Runs in Serverless Environment**
 - Node js 8 & above required!
 - Step 1: Download and install/update the Serverless framework in your machine. Refer this Serverless doc link for installation help - https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/
  
 - clone the project 
   > git clone git@github.com:RaghavPrabhu/Deep-Learning.git 

 - cd Deep-Learning/serverless_image_tensorflow/

 - export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<<YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY>>
 - export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<<YOUR AWS SECRET KEY>> 

 - npm install
 
 - sls deploy
